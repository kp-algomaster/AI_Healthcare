This starter code differs only in that we do not *LocalizeMaxima* on the output peaks.

Verify this by running the next cell. Your task is to improve the performance of the algorithm by adding the following features.\n","\n","### Refractory Period Blanking\n","Recall from the physiology lesson that the QRS complex is a result of ventricular depolarization, and that cellular depolarization happens when ions travel across the cell membrane. There is a physiological constraint on how soon consecutive depolarization can occur. This constraint is 200 ms. Read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory_period_(physiology)#Cardiac_refractory_period). We can take advantage of this phenomenon in our algorithm by removing detections that occur within 200ms of another one. Preserve the larger detection.\n","\n","### Adaptive Thresholding\n","The QRS complex height can change over time as contact with the electrodes changes or shifts. Instead of using a fixed threshold, we should use one that changes over time. Make the detection threshold 70% of the average peak height for the last 8 peaks.\n","\n","### T-Wave Discrimination\n","One error mode is to detect T-waves as QRS complexes. We can avoid picking T-waves by doing the following:\n","  * Find peaks that follow a previous one by 360ms or less\n","  * Compute the maximum absolute slope within 60ms of each peak. Eg `np.max(np.abs(np.diff(ecg[peak - 60ms: peak + 60ms])))`\n","  * If the slope of the second peak is less than half of the slope of the first peak, discard the second peak as a T-wave\n","Read another description of this technique [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan%E2%80%93Tompkins_algorithm#T_wave_discrimination)\n","\n","After implementing these three techniques you should see a significant increase in precision and recall. I ended up with 0.95 and 0.87. See if you can beat that!
